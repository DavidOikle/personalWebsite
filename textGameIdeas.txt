Text file for brainstorming some ideas for the Basic Text game.

What's the combat? Right now it's just a matter of having a regular attack. What's the benefit to a wizard casting a spell, a rouge shooting a bow?
Can do a similar idea to what Slice and Dice does, where there are modifiers to any ability.
A fireball does whatever damage, and also has the FIRE tag, which does extra damage aganist say, FIRE-WEAK targets.
Almost a pokemon style thing?
A bow has RANGED, any sort of melee weapon has MELEE. Can also go wild and do things like SLASHING, BLUNT, etc.
Probably best to keep it simple for now. 

To start, is it ranged, or melee? 
Does it have an element attached to it?

And conversley on the enemy side, have weakness's / resistances.
Keep it simple for now where its either X2 or X0.5 damage.
A fire elemental takes less damage from fire spells for example.

In addition, the melee/ranged can also provide a modifer on accuracy, and maybe eventually a thorns type effect.
A lightning elemental can do some additional damage to melee attacks that wouldnt be present on ranged hits. 
A ranged hit can have higher accuracy to a target that has FLYING.

So, instead of having Attack/casting a spell/shoot a bow/etc be hard coded to the classes, instead have them factory functions that have modifiers attached to them.
And at the same time, make the enemies factory functions that have modifers for their things like flying/an element/etc.

Probably don't actually NEED to make all these with factory functions, but I associate the idea of having modifers and such to them due to how Code academy approaches them.

STEP 1: Remake all abilities and enemies as factory functions. Have just the melee/ranged modifier for the weapons/spells for now. Enemies get basic elements if applicable.

THERE IS AN OPTION TO GO FULL POKEMON AND MAKE EVERYTHING HAVE A ELEMENT WITH IT. Actually nah don't do this, fuck it.
