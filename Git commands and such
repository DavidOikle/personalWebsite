Pushing a folder/repository to Github

After doing all the linking (notes to come later, as I've already done it a few times so it works for my current project),
1: Find the desired folder/repo. (Odin-Project/repos/personalWebsite).
2: git add . (the . adds the whole folder, otherwsie just do a file name).
3: git commit -m "Commit Message" 
4: git push.
5: Confirm update on github by checking the update history, or the file's changes.

To pull changes from github to a local folder:
1: Find the desired folder/repo. (Odin-Project/repos/personalWebsite).
2: Git pull (maybe pull . , need to test more).
