<!-- A project I'd like to do that would in theory be fairly simple is adapting tabletop games to run in a browser. NOTE THAT ITS BEEN A MONTH OR TWO SINCE I PLAYED A TORCH IN THE DARK, SO A LOT OF THIS IS GOING OFF MY MEMORY AND MAY BE WRONG. WOOPS.

                                GENERAL NOTES

The first one I'd like to do is A Torch in the Dark, a single player dungeon crawler. 

Most of it is based on a combination of a deck of cards, and rolling some dice. 

The deck itself serves as a pool for different encounters. 

Basicly, build a character using a combination of user inputs (Buttons, text fields/boxes, drop down menus, multiple choice options).
These inputs would determine things like your character's skills, their items, their status, etc etc.

The screen would need to have the following elements:

A text field for what just happened/is happening. EG: What card did you draw? 
A list of options for the player. Given the nature of tabletop, this could just be a lsit of everything, or could just be what the player character is skilled in (Maybe both?)
A result field for what the player just did.
An inventory and characrer status area (This could all be rolled into an always shown player sheet).
Information about the overal game; Which dungeon the player is in, how many cards have been drawn, or other important items.

Given that A torch in the Dark relies on the player to self govern what abilities would be relevant to each situation, this can be built into the game.
IE: A card says you face off aganist a foe. The typical play would be to fight, sneak, or parley with them.
However there is definatly a world where a wizard busts out their knowledge of Arcana and thats impressive/indimitading/whatever else to the foe and they get by.

Realted to this, stick to just translaitng over the descriptions of things as they are. ATITD relies on the player to use their imagination for encounters. 
"You come across an old friend" can go a near infinite amount of ways. If this was a Dungeon World or Blades in the Dark game, I might rely on instead writing random encounters and such.
A quick side note for DW or BIND game; write larger stories and use tags to tell them. IE roll for a dungeon and wow, you got the necromancer dungeon. Theres 30 possible encounters, which have to go in a rough order.
Such as starting with the outside, then a handful of encounters inside, a setpiece or two that has to happen, and then a boss. Outside can have 2-3 varriants, 20ish of the encounters are for the random ones, and then the setpieces and final encounter can either be static, single encoutners, or have 2-3 varriants aswell.
						
				IMPORTANT:
Saving isn't exctally gonna be a thing yet. Once some of the work is done, maybe the first dungeon or evne just the first few encounters, develope a saving function. Start with something simple(if this is simple...) like outright downloading the JS file, eventually have it stored in a server and finally have it attached to a login of some sort.

                                PART 1: SETUP: CHARACTER BUILDER
Let's start with a character sheet. Can basicly treat this as a programable PDF that needs the following things:
Character name/description.
SKills.
A set number of points to put in those skills. (XP system that gives extra points? Need to reread the rules for ATITD.
Inventory. Items are from a drop down list maybe. Like skills, needs a way to limit how many items the player can have. Will adjust the inventory tetris thing the normal game does and just have a max load, with each item taking a certain amount of load.
I think ATIDT has something for character status, due to being injured and such. Make it a text field so the player can add them themselves (Again, we're relying on the player to meet us halfway here for this kind of stuff. Eventually i'd like to automate it more).

A lot of this is gonna end up being let variables huh.
