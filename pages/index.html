    /* <h3 class='content'>About me</h3>
    <p class='content'>Hello! My name is David Oikle and welcome to my website. The goal is for this, in addition to my Github page, to act as a living portfolio piece. Take a look around and let me know what you think!</p>
    <p class='content'>My day job is working as a Master Control technican at the CBC in Toronto, while in my spare time I am studying web development and coding in general, via a combination of Code Academy, The Odin Project, and trusty Google.</p>
    <p class='content'>My goals are to continue with learning front end web development with a focus on HTML, CSS, and JS, before eventually shifting toward backend development. !</p>
    <p class='content'>When working from home, I primarily work via a virtual machine with Xubuntu. Right now a lot of that is just remembering commands for things like git, and properly practicing uploading/downloading files to and from Github. Remotely, I use Code Academy's workspace's, as I find them convient, while still maintaing a fair amount of usability. Right now I'm just copy/pasting things to/from GitHub/Code Academy as needed, which isnt ideal but it's easy enough.</p>
    <p class='content'>Take a peek at my example projects above to see what kind of work I've succesfully done, or drop me a line on your platform of choice (links are at the bottom of the page).</p>
    <p class='content'>Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
    <p class='content'>David Oikle</p> */
