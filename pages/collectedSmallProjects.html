<h3>Collected Small Projects</h3>
<p>This page contains a variety of smaller projects I've worked on, including things like calculators, converts, generators, and more. It's as much to show what I've succesfully coded, as it is to act as a repository for myself to reference at a later date.</p>
<p>Many of these will have some overlap with other projects. The random number generator for example will become a crucial key to the "Basic Web Game" project I've been working on, as is integrating JS code direclty into the HTML via a seperate JS file.</p>
