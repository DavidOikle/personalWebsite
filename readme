This is the base index for my personal website!

The current goal is to make the index contain a basic resume, and to link to any side projects I've done (Projects from other websites are in the EXTENRAL PROJECTS repository). Once some side projects are properly added with the HTML/CSS/JS, the whole website will act as a portfolio! :D
